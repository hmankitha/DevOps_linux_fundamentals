# Introduction to Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system that is used everywhere — from servers and cloud platforms to Android phones.
It’s the backbone of most DevOps tools, and learning it is the first step toward becoming a DevOps engineer.


## What Exactly Is Linux?

Linux is a Unix-like operating system that acts as a bridge between your computer hardware and software.
It controls memory, CPU, storage, and allows applications to communicate with the system.

The most interesting thing about Linux is that it’s **open-source** — which means anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code.


## Main Components of Linux

1. **Kernel** – The core part of the OS. It communicates directly with the hardware.
2. **Shell** – The interface that takes user commands and gives them to the kernel to execute. (For example: Bash shell) 
3. **File System** – Organizes all data and files in directories. 
4. **User Space** – Where user programs and applications run.


## Features of Linux

- Multi-user system – Multiple people can use the same machine safely.
- Multitasking – Can run several processes at once. 
- Security – Has strong user permissions and access controls. 
- Portability – Runs on almost any hardware. 
- Open Source – Free to use and modify.


## Why DevOps Engineers Use Linux

- Most servers and DevOps tools (like Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes) run on Linux.
- Easier to automate tasks with shell commands and scripts. 
- It’s lightweight, stable, and highly customizable. 
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) use Linux as the default system for virtual machines.


## Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)

| Distro | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Ubuntu** | Beginner-friendly, widely used in cloud and DevOps. |
| **CentOS / RHEL** | Stable enterprise-grade Linux. |
| **Debian** | Reliable and often used as a base for others. |
| **Fedora** | Cutting-edge with new features. |

##Summary

Linux is the heart of DevOps. 
Understanding its structure, commands, and behavior will make it easier to work with servers, containers, and automation tools later.
